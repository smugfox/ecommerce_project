Values('Antennae Galaxies','The galaxies — also known as NGC 4038 and NGC 4039 are locked in a deadly embrace. Once normal, sedate spiral galaxies like the Milky Way','1','7800','arp18.jpg');

Values('Messier 77','Messier 77, a galaxy in the constellation of Cetus, some 45 million light-years away from us. The streaks of red and blue in the image highlight pockets of star formation along the pinwheeling arms, with dark dust lanes stretching across the galaxy’s starry centre. The galaxy belongs to a class of galaxies known as Seyfert galaxies, which have highly ionised gas surrounding an intensely active centre.','1','10000','Messier_77.jpg');

Values('Leo Triplet','35 million light-years in the constellation of Leo. Together with Messier 65 and NGC 3628, Messier 66 is the member of the Leo Triplet, a trio of interacting spiral galaxies, part of the larger Messier 66 group. Messier 66 wins in size over its fellow triplets — it is about 100 000 light-years across.','1','30000','Leo_triplet.jpg');

Values('Cartwheel Galaxy','Lying about 500 million light-years away in the constellation of Sculptor, the cartwheel shape of this galaxy is the result of a violent galactic collision. A smaller galaxy has passed right through a large disc galaxy and produced shock waves that swept up gas and dust — much like the ripples produced when a stone is dropped into a lake — and sparked regions of intense star formation (appearing blue). The outermost ring of the galaxy, which is 1.5 times the size of our Milky Way, marks the shock wave’s leading edge. This object is one of the most dramatic examples of the small class of ring galaxies.', '1', '30000','cartwheel.jpg');

Values('NGC 3314', 'This pair of overlapping galaxies are called NGC 3314. While the two galaxies look as if they are in the midst of a collision, this is in fact a trick of perspective: the two are in chance alignment from our vantage point.','1','5000','NGC_3314.jpg');

Values('Holmberg II','The galaxy is dominated by huge bubbles of glowing gas, which are sites of ongoing star formation.  As high-mass stars form in dense regions of gas and dust they expel strong stellar winds that blow away the surrounding material. The cavities are also blown clear of gas by the shock waves produced in supernovae, the violent explosions that mark the end of the lives of massive stars.', '1','28000','holmberg2.jpg');
