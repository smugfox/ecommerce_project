Ecommerce Project


This is my E-shop that I built for the Cloud Academy porgram that mock sells galaxies.  

I used HTML, CSS, PHP, jQuery, MYSQL, and jcart to build the web app.  

Have a look and tell me what you think of it.  It's pretty bare bones, and I know that it's definitely not perfect, but 
it works!
